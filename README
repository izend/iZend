iZend is a PHP engine for developing well structured web applications 
with a content manager. It's aimed at programmers who want full 
control on the software they use with maximum adaptability and
reusability. It's simple to understand, easy to extend, open to other
components in PHP, Javascript or Flash. It's intended to become your
own very quickly while keeping all the benefits of a software
program developed and shared by an open source community.

iZend is built with a straightforward MVC architecture specially 
designed for organizing publications in several languages and for
different media. It includes a content editor, a search engine and a
set of presentation models. It can manage a community of users with
specific privileges.

iZend is normally hosted by a LAMP like web server but it can work
without a database and take very little space on disk. Put online a
teaser for a website in several languages with a contact page in just
a few minutes!

Start by reading INSTALL.

Thank you for your interest in iZend!
